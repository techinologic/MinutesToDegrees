# MinutesToDegrees
Coppin CS Coding Challenge #2

   This program returns the angle that is formed by the
   minute hand and the 12 o’clock mark on the clock.

   Example:

   If the input is: 15 then your program should return 90 because
   a 90-degree angle is formed by the minute hand and
   the 12 o’clock mark on the clock.
